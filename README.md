# Awesome .NET! 

A collection of awesome .NET libraries, tools, frameworks and software

When you are inspired by community awesomeness then you clone and build upon it. The result is a .NET version of the awesome-* pages here on Git. .NET is a great platform (if you're a .NET dev then you know that already) but the Git community and Open Source community isn't as strong as it should be. So fork, add, change, and let's build a great Git resource for .NET devs!

Shamelessly inspired by [awesome-ruby](https://github.com/markets/awesome-ruby),[awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php), [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python), [frontend-dev-bookmarks](https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks) and [ruby-bookmarks](https://github.com/dreikanter/ruby-bookmarks).

Contributions are always welcome! Please take a look at the [contribution guidelines and quality standard](https://github.com/valien/awesome-dotnet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/valien/awesome-dotnet/graphs/contributors), you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! The goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources.
